Correct: Oxygen bound to haemoglobin, carbon dioxide as dissolved hydrogen carbonate ion and carbon dioxide molecules.

Oxygen is carried by red blood cells in the special carrier called haemoglobin. This allows far more oxygen to be carried than could be if the oxygen molecules were simply dissolved. Some carbon dioxide is carried by haemoglobin (25%), but the largest amount (75%) is carried in the form of dissolved carbon dioxide molecules and hydrogen carbonate ions.

Question 26



Which of the following provides the most energy per gram when used in the human diet?

Correct: fats

Fats provide over twice as much energy per gram as glucose or proteins. Starch is broken down into glucose, and so provides the same amount of energy as glucose.
